In the Admin Badge panel, you should see a list of currently available badges.

![Select Badge to Edit](/docs/img/SelectBadgeToEdit.png)

Click on the name of a badge to see and edit the badge details.

![Edit Badge](/docs/img/EditBadge.png)

All the badge details are editable in the same way they would be if you were [creating a badge](/docs/admin/create-badge.md).
