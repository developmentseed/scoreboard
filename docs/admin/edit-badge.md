In the Admin Badge panel, you should see a list of currently available badges.

![Select Badge to Edit](../assets/SelectBadgeToEdit.png)

Click on the name of a badge to see and edit the badge details.

![Edit Badge](../assets/EditBadge.png)

All the badge details are editable in the same way they would be if you were [creating a badge](create-badge.md).
