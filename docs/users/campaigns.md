## What are campaigns?

Campaigns are mapping projects that you can contribute to by mapping or by verifying mapping done by others.

## How do I find campaigns?

Visit the [campaigns]({{appURL}}/campaigns) page to see a list of campaigns.

## How do I keep track of the campaigns I work on?

On your dashbaord you can view campaigns that you've favorited and campaigns that have been assigned by teams.

- **Favorite campaigns**
  - See a list of campaigns you've personally chosen to work on by [favoriting campaigns](/users/favorite-campaigns)
- **Team campaigns**
  - The [teams you join](/users/teams) assign campaigns
