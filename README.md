## Installation

We use [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) for installation and package management

     $ yarn
     $ yarn bootstrap

## Populate Data

For the frontend and the API works, you must have the data loaded on the local database:

     $ yarn clocks 

## Serve

This command will start both the frontend and the api together

     $ yarn start 

To start the services individually do:

     $ yarn api
     $ yarn frontend
