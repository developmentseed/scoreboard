## Installation

We use [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) for installation and package management

     $ yarn
     $ yarn bootstrap

## Populate Data

For the frontend and the API to work, you must have the data loaded on the local database:
     $ yarn createdb
     $ yarn clocks 

## Serve

This command will start both the frontend and the api together

     $ yarn start 

To start the services individually do:

     $ yarn api
     $ yarn frontend

## Test

We have provided some unit tests in api/tests/test.js. To run:

    $ yarn test

## Generating Docs

If you make changes to the API documentation make sure to update the README for the API which is auto-generated from the swagger YAML by running:

     $ yarn docs
