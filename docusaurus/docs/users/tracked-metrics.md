Scoreboard tracks the following metrics:

- Number of buildings added
- Number of points of interest added
- Km of roads created
- Km of waterways created
- Km of coastlines added or modified

These metrics are then aggregarted _over time_ at the `individual`, `campaign` and `country` levels. Scoreboard uses these metrics to award badges, create leaderboards and provide feedback on where to map next.
