You can track the campaigns you want to work on by favoriting campaigns.

To add a campaign as a favorite, go to the campaigns list and select a campaign.

Next click the **Add Favorite** button.

You'll see the **Add Favorite** button become a **Remove Favorite** button. Any time you want to remove the campaign from your favorites list, navigate back to that campaign and click the **Remove Favorite** button.
