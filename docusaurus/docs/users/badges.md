## What are badges?

When you complete certain objectives, badges will show on your public profile to celebrate your achievement. There are a handful of badges built in to scoreboard, and [admins can create new ones](admin/create-badge.md).

## How do I earn badges?

There are a wide range of badges you can earn by mapping.

Visit your dashboard to see a list of the badges you've earned so far, that you're currently working on, and that you've not yet started.

## Where do I see a list of badges?

To see a list of badges:

- Log in to Scoreboard if you haven't already
- After logging in, you'll be redirected to your dashboard
- At the bottom of your dashboard you can see badges that are in progress, that you've earned already, or a list of all badges

> Scoreboard also comes with a list of included badges, you can see the list [here](users/default-badges.md)
  
## How do I add a new badge?

If you're an administrator, you can add or edit badge information. To learn about managing badges on Scoreboard, visit the [badges admin docs](admin/badges.md).
