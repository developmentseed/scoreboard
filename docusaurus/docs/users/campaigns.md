## What are campaigns?

Campaigns are mapping projects that you can contribute to by mapping or by verifying mapping done by others.

## How do I find campaigns?

Learn more about [Searching for Campaigns in Scoreboard](users/campaigns-search.md)

## How do I keep track of the campaigns I work on?

On your dashboard you can view campaigns that you've favorited and campaigns that have been assigned by teams.

- **Favorite campaigns**
  - See a list of campaigns you've personally chosen to work on by [favoriting campaigns](users/favorite-campaigns.md)
- **Team campaigns**
  - The [teams you join](users/teams.md) assign campaigns

Read more about the dashboard in the [dashboard guide](users/profile.md).
